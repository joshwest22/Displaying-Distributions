<h1> Spread</h1>
<p>The spread of data can be measured as percentiles starting with the median (a resitant statistic), as it is consistently in the 50th percentile of the data .</p> 
<p>Besides precentiles (which counts by part per 100), there are deciles (counts by 10), quintiles (divide the data into 5ths), and quartiles (which divides the data into fourths or quarters)</p>
